# hello-world
My first time making a repo. I'm just starting my journey towards becoming a developer.

I have someone who wants me to maintain their existing website, they also want me to create a full stack web app for them.

It will be very challenging as I've previously only had a little experience in game development with Corona & Lua.

Gotta put in the time and keep myself in learning mode!
