# hello-world
1st time making a repo
I'm starting my journey towards becoming a developer.
I have sometime who wants me to maintain their existing website, they also want me to create a full stack web app for them.
It will be very challenging as I've previously only had a little experience in game development with Corona & Lua.
Gotta put in the time and keep myself in learning mode :)
